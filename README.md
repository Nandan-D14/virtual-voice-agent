# Nexus: The Autonomous Cloud Desktop Agent

Nexus is a state-of-the-art, voice-enabled autonomous agent designed to navigate, control, and execute complex workflows within a secure, persistent cloud-based desktop environment. Powered by the latest **Gemini** models through **Google Vertex AI**, Nexus bridges the gap between conversational AI and real-world task execution.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- **Leverages Gemini 1.5 Pro, 2.0 Flash, & 2.5/3.0 Preview Models** for reasoning, vision, and voice.
- **Built with the Google GenAI SDK** for seamless integration with Vertex AI endpoints.
- **Powered by Google Cloud Services**, including Cloud Run (Serverless Compute), Artifact Registry, and Secret Manager.
- **Secure Sandbox Execution** using E2B Desktop Sandboxes for safe, isolated code and browser operations.

Core runtime flow (Agent + Gemini):

```text
User -> Frontend (Next.js) -> Backend (FastAPI /ws + REST)
Backend Orchestrator -> Gemini (reasoning + tool calls)
Backend Tools -> E2B Sandbox (browser/mouse/keyboard/bash/screenshot)
Screenshot/Audio -> Gemini Vision + Gemini Live
Gemini output -> Backend -> Frontend (text/audio/events)
```

## 🌟 Features & Functionality
- **Autonomous Desktop Control:** Navigate a full Linux desktop via mouse/keyboard simulation and screen perception (Vision).
- **Voice & Live Interaction:** Low-latency, multi-modal conversations powered by Gemini Live.
- **Session Persistence:** Save and resume sandbox states, allowing for multi-day, complex operations.
- **Google Drive Integration:** Authenticate with OAuth to mount and sync files directly between your local machine and the cloud agent.
- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK):** End-to-end encrypted storage for personal API keys, giving users total control over their compute costs.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **AI/LLM:** Google Gemini (Vertex AI), Google GenAI SDK.
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), Pydantic (Settings/Validation).
- **Execution:** E2B Desktop Sandboxes (V8/WASM).
- **Authentication & Database:** Firebase Auth, Firestore.
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Run, Google Artifact Registry, Google Secret Manager.

## ⚙️ Spin-up Instructions (Reproducibility)

### 1. Prerequisites
- Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI and Cloud Run APIs enabled.
- Firebase Project for Authentication and Firestore.
- E2B API Key (available at [e2b.dev](https://e2b.dev)).

### 2. Backend Setup (Agent)
```bash
cd agent
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -e .
cp .env.example .env  # Fill in your GCP and Firebase credentials
uvicorn nexus.server:app --reload
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local  # Fill in your Firebase and Agent URL
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Reproducible Testing

To verify the agent's functionality, judges can follow these test cases once the project is spun up:

### Test 1: Autonomous Browser Control (Vision & Tools)
1.  Open a new chat session.
2.  Command the agent: *"Open google.com and search for 'latest AI news'."*
3.  **Verification:** The agent should open the browser in the sandbox, navigate to the URL, and use visual perception to identify the search box and results.

### Test 2: Terminal Operations (Bash execution)
1.  Command the agent: *"Create a folder named 'nexus-test', and inside it, create a file called 'hello.py' that prints 'Hello from Gemini'."*
2.  Command the agent: *"Run that python file."*
3.  **Verification:** The agent should execute the commands in the sandbox terminal and return the output ("Hello from Gemini").

### Test 3: Voice Interaction (Multi-modal)
1.  Click the microphone icon to start a Live session.
2.  Speak to the agent: *"Tell me what you see on the screen right now."*
3.  **Verification:** The agent should capture a screenshot, analyze it using the Vision API, and reply via audio with a description of the current desktop state.

### Test 4: Persistence (State Management)
1.  Open a terminal in the sandbox and run `touch persistence_check.txt`.
2.  End the session.
3.  Start a new session immediately.
4.  Ask the agent: *"Is the file persistence_check.txt still there?"*
5.  **Verification:** The agent should confirm the file exists, demonstrating the persistent sandbox snapshot feature.

## ☁️ Google Cloud Deployment (Automation & Proof)

### Automated Deployment
This project includes a fully automated deployment script: **`deploy/gcp/deploy.sh`**.  
This script handles:
1.  **Artifact Registry** repository creation.
2.  **Google Cloud Build** for containerizing both the agent and frontend.
3.  **Cloud Run** deployment with proper environment variable and Secret Manager injection.

### Proof of Deployment
- **Deployment Script:** [View `deploy/gcp/deploy.sh`](./deploy/gcp/deploy.sh)
- **Vertex AI Implementation:** [View `agent/nexus/vision.py`](./agent/nexus/vision.py) for direct integration with Vertex AI endpoints.
- **Live Logs Proof:** [Link to screenshot/video of Cloud Run logs](https://link-to-your-proof.com)

## 💡 Findings & Learnings
Throughout the development of Nexus, several key insights were discovered:
- **Vision-Driven UX:** Fine-tuning the balance between screen resolution and Vision model latency is critical for a responsive "real-time" feel.
- **Hybrid Auth:** Implementing the BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model required robust encryption (AES-GCM) to ensure user keys are never stored in plaintext on the server.
- **Persistent Sandboxes:** Managing the lifecycle of E2B sandboxes (Pause/Resume) significantly reduces the overhead of re-initializing complex development environments.
- **Vertex AI Scalability:** Utilizing Vertex AI's regional endpoints (e.g., `us-central1`) provided the necessary stability for streaming audio and vision tasks compared to global-only endpoints.
